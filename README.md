# 📊 R Labs and Data Analysis

This repository contains a collection of **R programming labs and applied data analysis exercises** developed as part of coursework in *Statistical Programming and Data Science*.
Each file demonstrates practical implementations of R concepts — from basic data structures to advanced machine learning simulations.

---

## 📘 Overview

The labs cover the full analytical workflow:

* Data structures and control statements
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Descriptive statistics and visualization
* Probability and simulation
* Machine learning basics
* Business and real-world data analysis

All scripts are written in **R**, with clear comments and modular code for easy learning and reuse.
